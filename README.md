## Methodology
The progress evaulation was performed using the Python programming language, by leveraging the pandas library for data manipulation and analysis. Fir the statistical method, this involved calculating the change in migration policy scores for 2019 and 2021 for each country, followed by filtering the data to identify countries with positive changes (showcasing progress) and negative changes (showcasing regression). This method allowed for a clear evaluation of policy development across different regions and countries.
